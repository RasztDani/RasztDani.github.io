Example and guide for documentation

== Overview

We decided to go for centralized and versionized documentation.
To make it easy to write while coding we went for a markup language.
Asciidoc seems like a good choice for wrtie once publish anywhere

== Goal

Write documentation and check it in with the source.
Have a pipeline run asciidoctor to turn .adoc to .html
Publish to gitlab pages

== Pipeline

documentation.gitlab-ci.yml
I borrowed the jekyll pipeline and adapted it for asciidoctor

== index.adoc

for now we start building the website by parsing the index.adoc file
